Github
_____________________
A proprietary web UI wrapper for managing git repos and workflows

* announced to csc in 2015 at techcom

* E-prise GitHub for DXC @
  github.csc.com

* open source projects at 
  github.com/dxc-technology

Git
---
*Developed by Linus Torvalds to be better than source code.

*High performance, distributed, content manager for anything that uses text

*Guarantees exactly what goes in comes out. memory corruption doesnt matter
due to cryptographic signing.

*Everyone has their own branch to pull requests seamlessly.

Git skill: Fork and Pull
------------------------
No asking for permission to get stuff, just begging forgiveness (lol)

Start with a main repository. It's then copied and "forked" in to other user's
accounts.

only time you need to ask permission is when you try to pull updated or edited
code back to the main repository. Otherwise it can be forked, cloned, edited, and
moved around freely with no permissions.

 RETURN TO MODULE FOR the GREAT 6 COMMANDS!!!

 Jenkins
 _____________________
 
 All about continuous integration and continuous delivery. 
 Used to build pipelines and integrate with developer tool chain like SCM and build scripts.
 Tests can be run automatically on check in and then new code can be piped all the way to production
 Jenkins is basically the CPU of all devops tools and integrates them.
 
 Jenkins is built on the idea of plugins and its architecture on its user interface is plugin based.
 
 the pipeline works as follows:
 
 Compile and unit test |+| Build server.
                       | |
acceptance testing     |+| deployed on build server
                       | |
integration testing    |+| deployed to integration environment
                       | |
acceptance testing     |+| deployed to UAT environment
                       | |
push artifacts         |+| deployed to artifact server
                       | |
production             |+| push to production


start Jenkins- (note this is a Docker command)
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins:2.46.1

breakdown of this command::
*docker run starts new container
*-p 8080:8080 maps port 8080 in container to port 8080 on host system. this allows access from a browser
*-p 50000:50000 maps port 50k which is for remote Java API
*jenkins:2.46.1 specifies the Jenkins image from Docker Hub and the needed version. versions are used due to Jenkins constantly evolving.

Ansible
_____________________

It's like chef, but with playbooks and plays instead of cookbooks and recipes. it's also newer.

Anible is actually an SSH robot that guarantees order of execution. It does robot things.
It can be used to run ad hoc commands on a remote host rather than logging in and using the remote CLI.
Commands can be structured in to a playbook and those playbooks can manage the source control.
I did not know it was a robot. That makes me like it more.


CMD Breakdown:

the hello world scenario.
ansible all -i hosts -u cent -b -a "echo 'Hello World'"

ansible runs Ansible ad hoc commands.
all applies command to all groups defined in the inventory
-i hosts specifies the file to read the inventory form
(also cat hosts lets you see contents of it)
-u is the user Ansible will log in with. 
cent, in this case, is the user.
-b makes Ansible become the root user. not always necessary.
-a is the action Ansible will take.
